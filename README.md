# Graph-Algorithms
The ropo contains the implementation of some graph algorithms 

## Graph Representaion 
Graph can be directed or undirected , Graph can be weighted or not
- The first line of the representaion contains two non-negative integers (n) the number of vertices and (E)the number of edges respectively
- The vertices are always numbered from 1 to n 
- Each of the following E lines defines an edge in the format u v where 1 ≤ 𝑢, 𝑣 ≤ 𝑛 are endpoints ofthe edge. If graph is undirected graph this defines an undirected edge between 𝑢 and 𝑣.
In case of a directed graph this defines a directed edge from 𝑢 to 𝑣. 
- If graph is weighted graph then each edge is given as u v w where 𝑢 and 𝑣 are vertices and 𝑤 is a weight.
