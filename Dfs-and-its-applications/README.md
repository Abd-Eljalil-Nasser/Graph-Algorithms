# DFS 
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
DFS is typically used to traverse an entire graph, and takes time O(|V|+|E|)}O(|V| + |E|),[4] where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| the number of edges.
